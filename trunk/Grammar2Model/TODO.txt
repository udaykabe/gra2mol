Some important notes:
- The context information does not works with bridge rules

About code and project:
- Use an action factory. Use Gra2MoLInterpreterActionFactory class!!
- Analyzing the execution of skip and normal rules (there must be something to reuse)
- Some of the CSTTemplateModelBuilder should be included in its superclass (TemplateModelBuilder). In fact, maybe 
CSTTemplateModelBuilder could be deleted and its method included in TemplateModelBUilder
